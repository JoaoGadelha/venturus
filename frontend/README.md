# Venturus Job Test

This project was developed as a job test for Venturus.

## The App
The app was built with React.js and illustrates an interface for creating and configuring soccer teams. It is composed of two pages, one that displays all the teams the user has created, a board displaying average ages of players and another board displaying percentages of picks for a chosen team. The second page is opened whenever the user wants to create a new team or configure an already existing one. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
